        <h1>5 ways hotel stays will change after COVID-19</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Cleanliness</li>
            <p>Travellers have always rated hotel cleanliness highly, but will be hyper-conscious and vigilant around it going forward. Hotels will need to demonstrate that they have implemented enhanced health and safety protocols for cleaning guest rooms, meeting spaces and common spaces in their properties, as well as back-of-house areas. It is expected that auditing initiatives will ultimately be implemented to measure hotel compliance with a stated criteria for cleanliness. </p>
            <li>Dining</li>
            <p>Who doesn't love starting the day off with a plate of muesli, scrambled eggs, sliced cheeses and meats, toast, strawberry yoghurt and a pain au chocolat? Alas, while we all adore the breakfast buffet, it may become a thing of the past. The problem is that social distancing will be impossible to maintain as we all crowd around various food and beverage stations, and the communal handling of jugs and tongs is just too risky going forward. It looks like individually plated and served meals will become the norm, or “grab-and-go” options, like the one offered by Drury Hotels in hotels where team-service models are not available.</p>
            <li>Leisure</li>
            <p>Chilling out in hotel pools and getting active in their gyms are great perks to staying at hotels, but new protocols will have to be followed when they re-open. It is likely that scheduled gym time-slots wil be introduced, for example, so we won't be able to just rock up when we feel like it. Ukactive, the fitness industry’s trade body in the UK, says that a gym’s maximum capacity should be based on three square metres per person. It advises spacing exercise equipment two metres apart to facilitate social distancing, and cleaning touch points of equipment after each person, in addition to the regular cleaning schedule.</p>
            <li>Check-in</li>
            <p>Where they are not executed on a self-service basis, changes to check-in procedures may include the installation of social distancing floor decals, front desk partitions and hand sanitising stations. Some hotels will require guests to take temperature checks before entering the hotel or while staying there.</p>
            <li>Technology</li>
            <p>We all enjoy being welcomed at reception by smiling hotel staff, but some hotels will now implement automated self check-in procedures. Virtual check-ins and digital keys using your phone will be used at some hotels like Hilton. “Once registered, guests have the ability to check-in, select their room and use their phone as their room key, without ever having to interact with the front desk,” says Phil Cordell, its global head of new brand development.</p>
