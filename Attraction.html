        <ol>
            <h2><li>Sigiriya</li></h2>
            <img src="images/8.jpg" alt="Sigiriya" >
            <p>Sigiriya is one of the most valuable historical monuments of Sri Lanka.Referred by locals as the Eighth Wonder of the World this ancient palace and fortress complex has significant archaeological importance and attracts thousands of tourists every year. It is probably the most visited tourist destination of Sri Lanka.</p>
            <p>The fortress complex includes remnants of a ruined palace, surrounded by an extensive network of fortifications, vast gardens, ponds, canals, alleys and fountains.Near-vertical walls soar to a flat-topped summit that contains the ruins of an ancient civilisation, thought to be once the epicentre of the short-lived kingdom of Kassapa, and there are spellbinding vistas across mist-wrapped forests in the early morning.</p>
            <h3>Eye catching places in Sigiriya.</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pavilion Gardens</li>
                    <img src="images/26.jpg" alt="Pavilion Gardens" >
                    <p>he Pavilion Gardens at Sigiriya where built during the reign of King Kasyapa I nearly 1600 years ago. They are the oldest surviving example of the charbagh quartered garden plan. It pre-dates similar designs at the Taj Mahal and Jaigarh Fort in India by over a thousand years. The gardens consist of a large walled compound with four massive L-shaped pools. At its center is an island linked to the main precinct by four causeways with ornate entrances. The pools were lined with brick, plastered, and then highly polished.</p>
                    <li>The Great Lion Gate</li>
                    <img src="images/25.jpg" alt="The Great Lion Gate" >
                    <p>For eighteen years in the late fifth century, the Sinhalese capital was moved from Anuradhapura to the remote site of Sigiriya. A thriving city operated at the base of a massive rock formation occupied before and after by buddhist monks. King Kassapa I, fearing military action, had a fortified palace built atop the rock of Sigiriya. The remains of these structures can still be visited today. Also remaining today, on a flat expanse halfway up the rock, are two giant sculpted paws as tall as a man. They are all that remains of a monumental lion sculpture. The remains show the suface was plastered. Stairs led up through the lion’s mouth and wound up the rest of the rock face to the palace at the summit.</p>
                    <li> Sigiriya Frescoes Paintings </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>KANDY</li>
                    <p>Many travellers overlook Kandy as merely the gateway to the famous blue train and their hill country adventures , but the City of Kings is also Sri Lanka’s undisputed cultural capital, and worthy of at least one night’s stay.There are plenty of significant historic and religious sites, such as the Temple of the Sacred Tooth, the Botanic Gardens, and the Kandy Lake, and it’s a great place to get better acquainted with the cultural side of Sri Lanka. </p>
                    <li>NUWARA ELIYA (NANU OUYA)</li>
                    <p>Nanu Ouya is the station for Nuwara Eliya; the gateway to the tea plantations and ‘Little England’. Once the favoured getaway for English and Scottish tea-growers seeking cooler climes, the area is dotted with old colonial villas and bungalows, as well as the most obvious relic of that time; the green tapestry of tea fields and vegetable gardens. </p>
                    <li>HATTON (ADAM’S PEAK)</li>
                    <p>Hatton is the gateway for most travellers en route to Adam’s Peak, one of Sri Lanka’s most stunning natural vistas as well as an important pilgrimage site.Adam’s Peak is revered by both Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims and Christians alike, and most Sri Lankans will undertake the pilgrimage to the top at least once in their lives. Climbing Adam’s Peak involves scaling 5,500 stairs (yes, you read that right!), generally in the dark, to watch the sunrise over the peak. </p>
                </ul>
                <h2><li> Beach Side</li></h2>

                <ul>
                <li>Hiriketiya</li>
                <img src="images/15.jfif" alt="Hiriketiya" >
                <p>On the south coast, the area around Dikwella is gradually becoming more popular with travelers looking to escape the increasing development further to the west. A string of relatively unspoiled beaches dot the coast here, most notably the stunning little horseshoe bay at Hiriketiya, which is backed by a small selection of great places to stay. </p>
                <li>Bentota</li>
                <img src="images/16jpg.jpg" alt="Bentota" >
                <p>One of the finest stretches of sand on the west coast, this beach runs south from magnificent Bentota lagoon and is lined with a string of alluring hotels. The southern end of the beach is home to some of the most appealing upmarket accommodation along this coastline, with a number of chic boutique hotels nestled amongst the palm trees. Bentota is also Sri Lanka's water sports hub. Behind the beach, the calm waters of the lagoon are perfect for kayaking and jet-skiing, while boat trips up the river to explore the mangroves and tangled waterways are easy to arrange. </p>
                <li>Arugam Bay</li>
                <img src="images/17.jpg" alt="Arugam Bay" >
                <p>Towards the southern end of the east coast, the village of Arugam Bay is a popular destination with independent travelers drawn by the charms of its beautiful, palm-fringed beach. Surfers originally put the village on the map by visiting to ride what are widely thought to be some of the best waves in Sri Lanka. The beach continues to attract plenty of surfers, but its laid-back vibe and offbeat charm provide wide-ranging appeal. </p>
                <li>Mirissa</li>
                <img src="images/18.jpg" alt="Mirissa" >
                <p>On the south coast, the fine sands of Mirissa Beach are backed by palm trees, while its clear waters and lively waves make it ideal for both swimming and surfing. A cluster of hotels and guesthouses offer a variety of accommodation choices nearby. Development here has been driven by Mirissa’s emergence as the whale-watching capital of Sri Lanka. Numerous whales can frequently be spotted reasonably close to the shoreline and multiple tour operators based in the village offer boat trips to see them during the season, which runs from December to April.</p>
